Description: Fits Bayesian models (amongst others) to dissolution data sets that can be used for dissolution testing. The package was originally constructed to include only the Bayesian models outlined in Pourmohamad et al. (2022) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12535>. However, additional Bayesian and non-Bayesian models (based on bootstrapping and generalized pivotal quanties) have also been added. More models may be added over time.
